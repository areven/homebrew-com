# Areven Homebrew Tap

Welcome to the official Homebrew Tap for [Areven](https://areven.com) products.
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a popular package manager for macOS, allowing seamless
installation and management of software.


## Usage

To install any Areven product with a single command:

```shell
brew install areven/com/<product>
```

Alternatively, you can add the tap first and install later:

```

This enables access to all Areven products without immediate installation.
